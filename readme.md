## Overview

- Paste a URL into a block somewhere. A dialog will then appear. Edit the title now.
  > Logseq usually leaves it as a URL and does not retrieve the title.
- If it is an online PDF, download it from that URL and import it into the asset.
  > This is especially useful for online PDF files that are updated with the same URL.
